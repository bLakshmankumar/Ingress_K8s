# Step - 1 -:
=============
# First we need to install ingress-controller on default namespace {using helm or manually}
# nginx-stable	https://helm.nginx.com/stable  {Using helm}.
# helm list command to verify

# Step -2 -:
# ----------
# Create an ingress file on terminal 
# apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
# kind: Ingress
# metadata:
#   name: elk-ingress
#   annotations:
#     nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
# spec:
#  ingressClassName: nginx
#  rules:
#  - host: a52cb6ee5124b4a7694aa5b46a22311a-175310273.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com
#    http:
#      paths:
#        - path: /
#          pathType: Prefix
#          backend:
#            service:
#             name: elasticsearch-master
#              port:
#                number: 9200
